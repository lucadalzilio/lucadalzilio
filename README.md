### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Welcome! I'm a senior researcher (Oberassistent) at [ETH Zurich](https://seg.ethz.ch/people/person-detail.MjEzODc2.TGlzdC80MTUwLC0xNTI1Njk2MTI3.html) and a member of Bedretto Underground Laboratory for Geosciences and Geoenergies ([BedrettoLab](http://www.bedrettolab.ethz.ch/en/home/)) to conduct experiments focused on geothermal energy and earthquake physics. 

My research focuses on Computational Geomechanics to understand the dynamics of Earthâ€™s deformation. In particular, I develop and apply multi-physics and multi-scale modeling methods to address practically relevant problems in earthquake physics, mechanics of porous media, and geodynamic processes across the scales.
